one of my imported ufo models had an issue: too many polygons. This was fixed by using a box collider and making a brand new mesh for it.

added 2 scripts: one rotates things (rotateStuff) and the other moves things. (moveStuff). 

I used the movestuff to make 2 ufos fly up. 

I made a platform spin around - one floating one and the main one. 

made a script to follow the ball.
