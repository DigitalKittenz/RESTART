# My Unity Project.
 
## Part of a RAD module

The controls for the game are: LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN arrows. Space makes you jump while simultaneously shooting prefabs. The aim of the game is to navigate through the obstacle course. 

<sub>Since Unity creates long file names use the following command in Git Bash:
$ git config --global core.longpaths true</sub>
